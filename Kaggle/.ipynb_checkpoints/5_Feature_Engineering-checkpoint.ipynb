    "# What is Feature Engineering \n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Learning What? :** \n",
    "\n",
    "- determine which features are the most important with mutual information.\n",
    "- invent new features in several real-world problem domains.\n",
    "- encode high-cardinalir categoriew with a target encoding. \n",
    "- create segmentation features with k-means clustering\n",
    "- decompose a dataset's variation into feature with principal component analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. The Goal of Feature Engineering :** \n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of feature engineering is simply to make your data better suited to the problem at hand.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Consider \"apparent temperature\" measures like the heat index and the wind chill. These quantities attempt to measure the perceived temperature to humans based on air temperature, humidty, and wind speed, things which we can measure directly. You could think of an apparent temperature as the result of a kind of feature engieerning, an attemp to make the observed data more relevant to what we actually care about. \n",
    "\n",
    "- improve a model's predictive performance\n",
    "- reduce computational or data needs\n",
    "- improve interpretability of the results \n",
    "\n",
    "**3. A Guiding Priciple of Feature Engineering :**\n",
    "\n",
    "For a feature to be useful, it must have a relationship to the target that your model is able to learn. Linear model, for instance, are only able to learn leiner relationship. So, when using a linear model, your goal is to transform the features to make their relationship to the target linear.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The key idea here is that a transformation you apply to a features becomes in essence a part of the model itself. Say you were trying to predict the Price of square plots of land from the Length of one side. Fitting a linear model directly ot Length gives poor results.   \n",
    "\n",
    "If we square the Length features to get \"Area\", however, we create a linear relationship. Adding Area to the feature set means this linear model can now fit a prarbola. Squaring a feature, in other words, gave the linear model the ability to fit squared features.  \n",

    "\n",
    "First encountering a new datasets can sometimes feel overwhelming. ou might be preseneted with hundreds or thousands of features without even a description to go by. Where do you even begin?  \n",
    "\n",
    "A great first step is to construct a ranking with a feature utility metric, a function measuring associations between a feature and the target. Then you can choose a smaller set of the most useful feture and the target. Then you cna choose a smaller set of the most useful features to develop initally and have more confidence that your time will be well spent.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The metric we'll use is called \"mutual information\". Mutual information is a lot like correlation in that it mesures a relationship between two wuantities. The advantage of mututal information is that it can detect any kind of relationship, while correlation only detects linear relationships.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Mutual information is a great general-purpose metric and especially useful at the start of feature development when you might not know what model you'd like to use yet. It is : \n",
    "\n",
    "- easy to use and interpret,\n",
    "- computationally efficient,\n",
    "- theoretically well-founded,\n",
    "- resistant to overfitting, and, \n",
    "- able to detect any kind of relationship\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Mutual information and what it measures**\n",
    "\n",
    "Mutual information descirbes relationships in terms of uncertainty. The mutual information between two quantities is a meausre of the extent to which knowledge of one qulitiy reduces uncertainty aobut the other. If you knew the value of a feature, how much more confident would you be about the target?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Interpreting Mutual information Scores**\n",
    "\n",
    "The least possible mutual information between quantities is 0.0. When MI is zero, the quantities are independent : neither can tell you anything about the other. Coversly, in theroy there's no upper bound to what MI can be. In practice though values above 2.0 or so are uncommon. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some things to remember when applying mutual information : \n",
    "- MI can help you to understand the relative potential of a features as a predictor of the target, considered by itself. \n",
    "- If's possible for a feature to be very informative when interacting with other features, but not so informative all alone. MI can't detect interactiosn between features. It is a univariate metric.\n",
    "- The actural suefulness of a feature depends on the model you use it with. A feature is only useful to the extent that its relationship with the target is one your model can learn. Jsut becuase a feature has high MI score doesn't mean you model will be able to do anything with that information. you may need to transform the feature first toe expose the association\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. What need to focus**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The scikit-learn algorithm for MI treats discrete features differently from continuous features. Consequently, you need to tell it which are which. As a rule of thumb, anything that must ahve a flaot dtypes is not discrete. Categorical can be treated by giving them a label encoding(or ordinaly encoding). \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Scikit-learn has two mutual information metrics in its feature_selection module: one for real-valued targets(mutaul_info_regresion) and one for categorical targets(mutual_info_classif)."

Unsupervised algorithms don't make use of a target; instead, thier purpose is to learn some property of the data, to represent the structure of the features in a certain way. In the context of feature engineering for predictions, you could think of an unsupervised algorightms as a \"feature discovery\" technique.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cluertering simply means the assigning of data points to group based upon how similar the points are to each other. A clustering algorithm makes \"birds of feature flock together\", so to speak. \n",

    "When used for feature engineering, we could attempt to discover groups of customers representing a market segment, for instance, or geographic areas that share similar weather patteerns. Adding a feature of clustering labels can help machine learning models untangle complicated relationships of space or proximity. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Cluster Labels as a Feature** \n",
    "\n",

    "The motivating idea of adding cluster labels is that the clusters will break up complicated relationships across features into simpler chunks.

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "K-means clustering measures similarity using ordinary stright-line distance (Euclidean distance, in other words). It creates clusters by placing a number of points, called centroids, inside the feature-space. Each point in the dataset is assigned to the cluster of whichever centroid it's closest to. The \"k\" in \"k-means\" is how many centroids (that is, clusters) it creates. You define k your self. \n",

The tessalation shows you to what clusters future data will be assigned; the tessallation is essentially what k-means learns from its training data.\n",
    "\n",

    "Let's review how the k-means algorithm learns the clusters and what that means for feature engineering. We'll focus on three parameters from scikit-learn's implementation : n_cluster, max_iter, and n_init.\n",

    "It's a simple two-step process. The algorithm starts by randomly initailizing some predefined number (n_clusters) of centriods. It then iterates over these two operation : \n",
    "1. assign points to the nearest cluster centroid\n",
    "2. move each centroid to minimize the distance to its points\n",

    "It iterates over these two steps until the centriods aren't moving anymore, or until some maximum number of iterations has passed (max_iter).\n",
    "\n",

    "It often happens that the initail random position of the centroids ends in a poor clustering. For this reason the algorithm repeats a number of times(n_init) and return the clustering that has the least total distance between each point and its centroid, the optimal clustering. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You many need to increase the max_iter for a large number of clusters or n_init for a complex dataset. Ordinarily though the only parameter you'll need to choose your self is n_cluster (k, that is). The best partitioning for a set of features depends on the model you're using and what you're trying to predict, so it's best to tune it like any hyperparamtetr (through cross-validation, say). "
