THe indented block of code following the : is run when the function is called. return is another keyword uniquely associated with functions. When Python encounters a return statement, it exits the function immediately, and passes the value on the right hand side to the calling context.\n",

    "4. Conditionals : Booleans are most useful when combined with conditional statements, using the keywords if, elif, and else. Conditional statements, oftten referred to as if-then statements, let you control what pieces of code are run based on the value of some Boolean condition. The if and else keywords are often used in other languages; its more unique keyword is elif, a contraction of \"else if\". In these conditional clauses, elif and else blocks are optional; additionally, you can include as many elif statements as you would like. \n",
