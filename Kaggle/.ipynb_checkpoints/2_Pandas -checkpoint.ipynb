    "We are using the pd.DataFrame() constructor to generate these DataFrame objects. The syntax for declaring a new one is a dictionary whose keys are the column names, and whose values are a list of entries. \n",
    "This is the standard way of constructing a new DataFrame, and the one you are most likely to encounter. The list of row labels used in a DataFrame is known as an index. We can assign values to it by using an index parameter in our constructor :  \n",

    "    2) Series :   \n",

    "1. Native accesors :  \n",
    "Native Python objects provide good ways of indexing data. Pandas carries all of these over, which helps make it easy to start with. In Python, We can access the property of an objects by accessing it as an attribute. A book objects, for example, might have a title property, which we can acess by calling 'book.title'. Columns in a pandas DataFrame work in much the same way.   \n",
    "If we have a Python dictionray, We can access its values using the indexing [] operator. 'book['title']'.  \n",

    "2. Indexing in pandas :   \n",
    "The indexing operator and attribute selection are nice because they work just like they do in the rest of the Python ecosystem. As a novice, this makes them easy to pick up and use. Hoever, pandas has its own accesor operators, loc and iloc. \n",
    "    - iloc : The first is index-based selection : selecting data based on its numerical position in the data. : revies.iloc[:, 0]\n",
    "    - loc : The secodn paradigm for attribute selection is the one followed by the loc operator : label-based selection. loc uses the information in teh indices to do its work. \n",
